# Campus-Placement-using-R

This project explores the factors influencing campus placement outcomes using a dataset of student profiles. We performed some data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization and model building in R to predict placement status. The goal is to provide insights into which academic and demographic factors contribute to successful job placements, the role of work experience in job placements, how the degree specialization affect salary offers and the importancee of past academic performance. 

This project aims to bridge the gap by analyzing student demographic, academic, and placement data to provide actionable insights for universities and students, helping to optimize career guidance programs and improve placement rates.

The steps followed in this project included Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Building and the Insights & Findings. 

### Business Insights from the Analysis
Academic Performance is a key predictor of Placement. According to the models used, students with higgher performance in schools have a higher placement rate with MBA percentage showing a stronger correlation with placement. This shows that universities should focus on strengthening students' academic skills especially in undergraduate and postgraduate courses to improve their employability.

Work experience increases chance of placement. This shows that universities should encourage internships, industrial training and freelance projects to boost students' work experience before graduating. 

Specialization in Business and Finance have higher salary offers. Career advisors should align students' skills and interests with market demand to help them choose the best specialization for better job prospects.

Lastly, gender gap in placement in salary. Male students have higher placement rates. Universities should implement programs to bridge this gap like industry networking, negotiation training and opportunities for mentorship especially for female students.
